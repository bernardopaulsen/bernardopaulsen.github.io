Sources of Study Material for Data Science
******************************************

Introduction
============

Studying is a valuable investment in the career of any professional. Acquiring new knowledge is an effective way to improve professional skills and the ability to understand and tackle complex challenges, while also increasing confidence and motivation.

There are various ways to study and delve into different subjects. Among the main study methods are YouTube videos (probably the most widely used by beginners), online courses, documentation, and books. In the following text, I will discuss the different study methods.

I will mention some study materials throughout the text, but it is worth noting that the list of study materials I will present includes only those that I have used myself and therefore have at least some knowledge of their content. I do not intend to provide an exhaustive list of materials available on the market, but I hope these recommendations can be useful for those seeking to enhance their knowledge and provide a general overview of the types of materials available. I will mainly mention materials that use the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ language, as it is my primary language and the one I use the most in my work. However, many of the concepts and techniques presented can also be applied in other programming languages.

.. _videos-on-youtube:

YouTube Videos
==============

YouTube can be an excellent source of information and knowledge about software development and data science. There are many channels that offer tutorials, lectures, and discussions on these topics, including some with high-quality content produced by experienced professionals in the field. Additionally, many of these channels are free, making them an accessible option for those who want to learn more about technology and data science without spending a lot of money.

Some examples of YouTube channels that provide content in the area of software development and data science are:

- `@sentdex <https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex>`_
- `@mCoding <https://www.youtube.com/@mCoding>`_

.. _online-courses:

Online Courses
==============

Online courses are an excellent way to learn about a technology or programming language as they are usually very practical and focused on providing the necessary knowledge to start working on a project. They offer a hands-on approach with exercises and projects that help consolidate knowledge and apply it in real-world situations.

There are online courses available on various platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, and many others. Prices vary widely, but they are often affordable, especially during promotional periods, making them even more attractive.

Some courses that I have completed and recommend are:

- `Learn Complete Python in Simple Way <https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-complete-python-tutorial-in-simple-way/>`_ (Udemy)
- `Python in Containers <https://www.udemy.com/course/python-in-containers/>`_ (Udemy)
- `The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/>`_ (Udemy)
- `Git Complete <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/>`_ (Udemy)
- `Machine Learning Foundations <https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations>`_ (Coursera)
- `Command Line in Linux <https://www.coursera.org/projects/command-line-linux>`_ (Coursera)

.. _documentations:

Documentations
==============

Documentation is an extremely detailed and up-to-date document, making it a valuable tool for day-to-day development. It provides precise and detailed information about the functions, methods, and libraries available in a specific technology or programming language. Documentation is especially useful when a developer needs specific information and needs to find it quickly.

I believe it is not necessary to provide examples of documentation.

.. _books:

Books
=====

Books, on the other hand, offer a broader and more in-depth approach to specific subjects. They are a great way to get a good introduction to a topic and understand the logic behind technology or programming languages. Books allow readers to explore a subject in depth, with detailed explanations and code examples that help grasp the concepts and apply them in practical situations. Furthermore, books often provide a broader perspective on the topic, contextualizing it in relation to other technologies or areas of knowledge.

There are several publishers specializing in IT books, including `Packt Publishing <https://www.packtpub.com/>`_, `O'Reilly Media <https://www.oreilly.com/>`_, `Manning Publications <https://www.manning.com/>`_, `Springer <https://www.springer.com/>`_, and `Wiley <https://www.wiley.com/en-br>`_. Each publisher has its own approach and covers a wide variety of subjects. I will only comment on Packt Publishing, O'Reilly Media, and Manning Publications since they are the ones I'm most familiar with.
