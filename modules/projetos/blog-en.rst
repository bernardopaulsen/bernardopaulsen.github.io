Data: Just the Beginning
************************

Welcome to my blog!

Throughout my career, I have developed a great passion for quantitative finance and data science, both in university and in the workplace. With this blog, I hope to share my experience and knowledge in this field.

Here, I will address the theory and practice of quantitative finance, from discussions about the nature of empirical science to tutorials on using technologies useful for data science.

I hope that the posts can be helpful and inspiring. Enjoy reading!
