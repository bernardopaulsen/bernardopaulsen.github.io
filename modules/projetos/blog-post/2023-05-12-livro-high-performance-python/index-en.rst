Recommendation: Book 'High Performance Python'
**********************************************

`High Performance Python, 2nd Edition <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/>`_ is an essential book for Python programmers who want to increase the efficiency and speed of their applications. It is published by O'Reilly Media.

Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed language, which can make it relatively slower compared to other languages like C or Java. However, with the book 'High Performance Python,' readers have the opportunity to learn various techniques that can be used to significantly improve the speed and efficiency of Python code.

The book presents several techniques for optimizing the performance of Python code, from efficiently using different data structures in Python to advanced strategies like task parallelization using the **multiprocessing** module.

Additionally, the book covers techniques such as profiling and vectorization of calculations as ways to improve the performance of Python code. Profiling is a technique that allows identifying which parts of the code are consuming more processing time, while vectorization of calculations involves using numerical computation libraries like **NumPy** to perform mathematical operations on arrays in a vectorized manner.

The book also addresses topics such as compiling Python code and using C extension modules through the **cython** library.

Another book that discusses performance in Python is `Fast Python <https://www.manning.com/books/fast-python>`_ by Manning Publications. I cannot comment on it as I haven't read it yet, but I'm providing the reference here as Manning usually publishes high-quality material.

I hope this post has been useful to you. I can say for sure that the book has been extremely helpful to me.
